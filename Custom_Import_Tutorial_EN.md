# Import your own chart into dynamite to play

## Step 1
Copy your chart, music, preview music and cover files into `data`(Android)/`Documents`(iOS) folder.

* Can only read audio files in `.mp3` format and image files in `.jpg` format
* Refer to [Main Guide](./README_EN.md) for detailed import methods

## Step 2
Modify the local `__rena_index_2` file to add an entry for your file

Entry Structureï¼š
```
B.<UUID>
Y?<Hidden chart?(0/1)>
R?<Ranked chart?(0/1)>
N?<Song Name>
S?<Music file path>
C?<Cover file path>
P?<Preview music file path>
U?<Charter>
W?<Artist>
I?<Chart info>
H?<Chart difficulty 1>;<Chart difficulty 2>; ...
M?<Chart file 1>;<Chart file 2>; ...
E.
```
* Any random 24-bit UUID will work
* All file paths are relative paths to `data`/`Documents` folder
* For multiple-diffed charts, the file paths correspond to the difficulties in input order
* It's allowed to have custom diff names
* If you don't want the chart to be identified as ranked or hidden, you can just leave out the whole line
